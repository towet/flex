# E-Commerce Web Shop App

I've utilized this app from [JavaScript Mastery, ECommerce Web Shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=377AQ0y6LPA&list=PL6QREj8te1P6wX9m5KnicnDVEucbOPsqR&index=5) video. Before telling about app, here is the link that I [published on netlify](https://e-commerce-by-emre.netlify.app/) and the gif that you can take a quick look through the app :

<h2> 1. Cloning and Running App :computer:</h2>



You can download this app to your local using `git clone https://github.com/towet/flex.git` command on your bash. Then open your terminal in the folder that you cloned and open your command line, use `yarn install` command. This command will install all the dependencies that I use in the app. Finally use `yarn start` command to run the app.

<h2> 2. About App :warning: </h2>




<h2> 3. Dependencies :open_file_folder:</h2>



In this app I've used **_Material UI_**, **_Commerce.js_**, **_, **_React-Router_** and **_React-Hooks_**.
There are the commands that you can use to install these dependencies. (I've used yarn, you can use `npm install` instead of `yarn add` if you're using npm).

- ` yarn add @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons`
- `yarn add @chec/commerce.js`
- `yarn add @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js`
- `yarn add react-router-dom`
- `yarn add react-hook-form`
